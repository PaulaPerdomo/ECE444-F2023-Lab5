# What are the pros and cons of TDD?

**Pros of TDD:**
Test-Driven Development promotes improved code quality, modularity, and maintainability. It enables early bug detection, which makes issues cheaper and easier to addressas the project/application progresses. A robust and passing test suite provides developers the confidence to refactor without fearing regressions. Furthermore, tests act as clear documentation of expected code behavior, offer immediate feedback during development, and encourage simplicity by prompting developers to write only the necessary code to pass tests. TDD can fit into Agile development by helping build feedback early on, helping mitigate critical bottlenecks that obstruct the quality and devlivery of software.

**Cons of TDD:** Despite its benefits, TDD introduces a learning curve that can initially slow down development. Writing tests can be time-consuming as the entire test suite must be maintaned in addition to the product code, and there's a risk of not achieving comprehensive test coverage. The added test suite introduces maintenance overhead, as changes to the codebase require updating tests. Over-reliance on TDD can give a false sense of security, especially if tests aren't thorough. Excessive or inappropriate use of mocking might lead to unrealistic test scenarios, and TDD might not be suitable for every development context, such as prototyping.
